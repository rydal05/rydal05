# About
Yo! I'm Ryan, a software developer with a main interest in game dev and desktop application silliness.
I've been on and off with programming and game development since 6th grade where I picked up Lua and coded small games on the Roblox platform.

I currently run and operate [Delf√≠nsoft](https://delfinsoft.itch.io/), my solo game development operation of which I have a couple of projects in the works that are yet to be released. I do game design, game logic & programming, art, music, and direction.
